This Python script uses the `pdf2image` library to turn pages from a PDF into images. It follows these steps:

1. It gets today's date in a specific format.
2. It sets the path for the PDF and images.
3. It combines the path with the current date to create the PDF file's location.
4. It converts PDF pages to images using `pdf2image`.
5. It saves each image with a filename including the page number.
6. The script relies on the `poppler` tool to handle PDF conversion.

This script is handy for extracting content from PDFs, like turning reports into image format for easy sharing or analysis. Just make sure you have the necessary libraries and tools installed before using it.
